# OneOrTwo
Final Assignment for Networks. OneOrTwo is a simple game from a simpler time.

There are two players, player1 and player2. One player is the asker and the other is the guesser. First, the asker is prompted to pick a number, either 1 or 2. Then, after the asker receives a confirmation, the guesser is queried for their number, either 1 or 2. If the guesser guessed the right number, they win and they become the new asker. Otherwise, the roles are maintained and another round is played.
